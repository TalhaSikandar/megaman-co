Based on your code structure and the provided files, hereâ€™s an analysis of your project and whether it should work for next-day stock price prediction:

## **Project Structure & Flow**

1. **Data Loading**  
   - Uses `load_data` from `data_utils` to load preprocessed train/val/test splits.
   - Input shape: `(num_samples, lookback_window, 6)` (6 features per day).

2. **Model Architecture**  
   - `LSTMLayer`:  
     - 1 LSTM layer (`hidden_size=64` by default).
     - 1 Linear (fully connected) output layer (`output_size=1`).
   - Takes a sequence of days (with 6 features each) and predicts the next day's price.

3. **Training Loop**  
   - Trains for a configurable number of epochs.
   - Tracks train/validation loss.
   - Supports checkpointing and early stopping.
   - Uses Adam optimizer for weight updates.

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Computes test loss, MAE, RMSE, and a tolerance-based accuracy.
   - Prints and saves these metrics.

5. **Metadata Saving**  
   - Saves hyperparameters and results to a JSON file for reproducibility.

6. **Inference**  
   - infer.py loads the trained model and makes predictions on test data.

## **Will It Work?**

### **Strengths**
- **Architecture:**  
  The LSTM + Linear setup is standard for time series regression and should be able to learn temporal dependencies in stock data.
- **Training/Evaluation:**  
  The training loop, validation, and evaluation metrics are implemented correctly.
- **Reproducibility:**  
  Hyperparameters and results are saved for future reference.
- **Inference:**  
  The inference script is simple and should work as long as the model and data are consistent.

### **Potential Issues / Things to Check**
1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Ensure your data is normalized/scaled (especially for LSTM models).
   - The lookback window and feature engineering should match between training and inference.

2. **Model Saving/Loading:**  
   - You use `pickle` for saving/loading. This works, but ensure the code/class definitions do not change between training and inference.

3. **Generalization:**  
   - Stock price prediction is inherently noisy and difficult. Even with a good model, real-world accuracy may be limited by the data and market randomness.

4. **Overfitting:**  
   - Monitor validation loss and use early stopping to avoid overfitting.

5. **Feature Importance:**  
   - The model uses 6 features. If some are not informative, consider feature selection or engineering.

6. **Output Interpretation:**  
   - The model predicts the next day's price as a regression value. Make sure you interpret and use this output correctly.

## **Conclusion**

**Yes, your project should work and is set up to predict the next day's stock price given a sequence of past days' features.**  
- The code is logically correct for a research/prototype project.
- For best results, ensure your data is well-prepared and monitor for overfitting.
- Real-world accuracy will depend on data quality and market unpredictability.
